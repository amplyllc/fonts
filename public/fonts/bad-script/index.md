<p>Bad Script started from a simple six-letter logotype and developed into a separate font, supporting Latin and Cyrillic character sets. It was completely made using a tablet to imitate casual and neat handwriting. Designed to resemble the designer's own handwriting, while making it systematic and smooth.</p> <p>Designed by Roman Shchyukin from Gaslight.</p>

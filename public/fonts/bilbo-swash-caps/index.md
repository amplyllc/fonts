<p>Bilbo Swash Caps is a sister family to the normal <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Bilbo">Bilbo</a>. It is very legible calligraphic style that has a masculine feel. This family is ideal for headlines and other display uses, while the normal Bilbo can also be used in body copy that requires added warmth to a message.</p>

<p>Against the typographical grey, Buda is a black and white typeface. The letters are shared by two contrasting weights, which clash and balance each other out. This typeface is inspired by Budapest, a paradoxal town, beautiful and ugly, fragile and exuberant. Like this town, the typeface Buda is an assemblage of heterogeneous elements which form a harmony.</p>
